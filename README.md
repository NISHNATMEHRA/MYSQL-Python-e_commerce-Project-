# SQL-Python E-commerce Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset using SQL for data querying and Python for data visualization. The aim is to derive insights from the data, ranging from basic customer and sales metrics to advanced revenue and retention analyses.

## Project Structure
- **Basic Queries**: Simple data retrieval and aggregation.
- **Intermediate Queries**: More complex aggregations and calculations.
- **Advanced Queries**: In-depth analysis and trend identification.

## Features

### Basic Queries
- List unique cities where customers are located.
- Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
- Find the total sales per category.
- Calculate the percentage of orders paid in installments.
- Count the number of customers from each state.

### Intermediate Queries
- Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
- Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
- Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
- Identify the correlation between product price and purchase frequency.
- Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.

### Advanced Queries
- Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
- Calculate cumulative sales per month for each year.
- Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
- Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
- Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

## Data Visualization
Graphs and plots are generated using Python libraries to visualize the insights derived from the SQL queries. These visualizations include trends, distributions, and comparisons that are crucial for understanding the e-commerce data.
